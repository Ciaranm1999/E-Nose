# E-Nose Sensor Data Analysis & Machine Learning Methodology

## 🎯 Complete Analysis Methodology
This document outlines the comprehensive methodology used for E-Nose sensor data analysis and machine learning classification for food spoilage detection.

## 📊 Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Dataset Overview
- **Batch 1 (Training)**: 3,534 samples over 72+ hours
- **Batch 2 (Testing)**: 3,528 samples over 72+ hours  
- **Total Dataset**: 7,062 sensor readings
- **Sampling Frequency**: Every few minutes (high temporal resolution)

### Sensor Configuration
- **MQ3 Alcohol Sensors**: Top and bottom positions for alcohol vapor detection
- **BME280 Environmental Sensor**: Temperature, humidity, and VOC resistance
- **Primary Features**: 5 core sensor measurements per timestamp

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Missing Value Handling**: Forward/backward fill for sensor gaps
2. **Outlier Detection**: 95th percentile filtering for derivative calculations  
3. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization for all ML models
4. **Temporal Features**: Hours from start calculated for time-series analysis
5. **Data Truncation**: Remove samples after sensor saturation/failure

## 📊 Labeling Strategy & Ground Truth

### Time-Based Classification Approach
The analysis employs a time-based labeling system using spoilage prediction timestamps:

- **Fresh (Class 0)**: > 48 hours before predicted spoilage
- **Spoiling (Class 1)**: 24-48 hours before predicted spoilage  
- **Spoiled (Class 2)**: < 24 hours before predicted spoilage

### Rationale for Time-Based Labeling
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Based on food science understanding of spoilage progression
- **Objective Measurement**: Uses quantifiable time-to-spoilage metrics
- **Practical Relevance**: Directly applicable to real-world food monitoring scenarios
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent labeling rules across different experimental batches

### Label Distribution Analysis
| Class | Batch 1 (Training) | Batch 2 (Testing) | Total Samples |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Fresh (0) | 1,031 (29.2%) | 1,128 (32.0%) | 2,159 |
| Spoiling (1) | 1,428 (40.4%) | 1,456 (41.3%) | 2,884 |
| Spoiled (2) | 1,075 (30.4%) | 944 (26.8%) | 2,019 |

### Hand-Labeled Validation Ranges
| Batch | Spoilage Start | Spoilage End | Duration |
|-------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Batch 1 | Hour 51.0 | Hour 65.3 | 14.3 hours |
| Batch 2 | Hour 77.0 | Hour 86.7 | 9.7 hours |

## 🔄 Cross-Validation Explained

### 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation Process:

1. **Split**: Training data divided into 5 equal parts (folds)
2. **Train**: Model trained on 4 folds (80% of data)
3. **Test**: Model tested on remaining fold (20% of data)
4. **Repeat**: Process repeated 5 times, each fold serves as test once
5. **Average**: Final score is average of all 5 test scores

### Stratified Cross-Validation Benefits:
- **Class Distribution Preservation**: Each fold maintains same class distribution as original dataset
- **Bias Prevention**: Prevents bias from imbalanced classes
- **Reliability**: More robust performance estimate than single train-test split
- **Statistical Validity**: Provides confidence intervals for model performance

### Implementation Details:
```python
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train_scaled, y_train, 
                           cv=StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42),
                           scoring='accuracy')
```

### Cross-Validation Results Interpretation:
- **CV Mean**: Average accuracy across all 5 folds
- **CV Std**: Standard deviation indicating model stability
- **Low Std (<0.05)**: Stable, consistent model performance
- **High Std (>0.15)**: Unstable model, sensitive to data variations
